# Nacu group 11
We've written our code in python. You can download the packages either
using the python poetry setup available here, or you can download them
with whatever package manager you prefer. In that case, please look at
[pyproject](pyproject.toml) for the required packages.

Each assignment is in its own folder, and instructions on how to generate
the exact output (should) be described in our answer for the relevant
exercise.
